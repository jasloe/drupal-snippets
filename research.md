### A few things to look into:
- Tugboat (visual recursion testing)
- Travis
- Post-CSS/Webpack theme (min)
- Development and production code splitting
- A decent, non-bloated image carousel
- Git sub-projects
- Documenting and applying patches via composer
- Digital Ocean application hosting (AWS is....ugh)
